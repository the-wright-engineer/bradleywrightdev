**Most times**, the escape from the city to the vast splendor of nature is the perfect medicine for stress and pressure. Ever since I was a little boy, I have enjoyed the outdoors and the peace that comes from nature. The woods were where I would find adventure, ponder life, and relax. The woods were also where I would go to escape and work through areas of depression, anger and grief. As a boy, I did not understand that nature was where God met me, as a man, I understand this more and more.

Currently, I am sitting on the porch of cabin in the mountains of Colorado. I am sipping at some local whiskey as I admire the moonlight reflecting off of the lake in front of me. This is probably the first time since my son was born where I have had a moment to sit back and take a deep breath. Oddly, I have not given much thought to how high-strung I have been lately. This has been a subtle stress in my life, must be why "they" call stress the "Silent Killer". There has not been one thing that I would say has been causing this stress. Between being a new father, a husband, a full time tech worker and church planting, there really has not been a opportunity to take a breath and reflect on my life right now.

Now that I have a moment to write and process, probably the biggest cause of this stress stems from being a new father. Having a son is wonderful, and there have been highs and lows naturally with a newborn, but my son has been having silent reflux issues that have put a strain on my wife and our marriage. I feel bad when I am able to escape to the office, where as she is stuck with him for another day by herself. Tension at home has been high and every day I look to leaving as early as I can and stay as late as I can. This is not how I want things to be and every day I fight the tempation to escape from the challenges and struggles.
