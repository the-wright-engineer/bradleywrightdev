**Most times**, the escape from the city to the vast splendor of nature is the perfect medicine for stress and pressure. Ever since I was a little boy, I have enjoyed the outdoors and the peace that comes from nature. The woods were where I would find adventure, ponder life, and relax. The woods were also where I would go to escape and work through areas of depression, anger and grief. As a boy, I did not understand that nature was where God met me, as a man, I understand this more and more.
