I am married to my beautiful wife, Haley, of three years. This year we welcomed our wonderful baby boy, Hudson. We currently live in Boston where we are helping start a church. I work as a Systems Enginner for a great company downtown.

>"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age." <cite>Matthew 28</cite>
